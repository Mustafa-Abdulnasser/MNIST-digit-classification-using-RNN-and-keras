The objective of this classification task is to create a machine learning model utilizing RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) and the Keras framework for accurately classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is designed to effectively analyze the sequential nature of the digit images and predict the correct digit labels. The MNIST dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the model, ensuring its capability to achieve high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits based on their pixel values.
